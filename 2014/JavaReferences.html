Perhaps the first trick of performance improvement is caching. Every
programmer knows that performance of programs can be improved if
somethings are cached in memory rather than recalculating or reading
from disk everytime. However, balancing caching with memory needs of
rest of the program is tricky. You can afford to cache a lot when
demand for memory from rest of the program is small. But the cache
should trim some of its entries when memory is needed by other parts
of her program.
</p>

<p>
Consider another scenario. You have a class, say <b>F</b>, you would like
to extend and associate some data with it. But <b>F</b> is final and you
don't have the ability to change it. Ideally, you would like to have
an instance of some other class <b>G</b> associated with each instance of
<b>F</b>. You could use a hash map with <b>aF</b> as key and associate <b>aG</b> with
it. While this works, when you don't need <b>aF</b> anymore, <b>aF</b> and <b>aG</b>
hang around in memory because they are in the hash map.
</p>

<p>
For our last scenario, consider an object which uses some
resource. When the object is reclaimed by the garbage collector, the
resource should also be freed. Ideally, we would like this to happen
without tracking the object's lifetime and explicitly initiating
resource cleanup. Note that <b>finalize</b> method intended for object
cleanup action is considered a nonstarter.
</p>

<p>
In all these cases, we would like the garbage collector to understand
a bit more about the references our code keeps. The <b>Reference</b> class
and its subclasses in <b><b>java.lang.ref</b></b> package provide us with the
tools to interact with the garbage collector. Each of the above
scenarios described above can be handled with a special type of
<b>Reference</b> object. The rest of the post shows some Java code to
illustrate the general ideas.

<h3 id="org2bf3ae9">Building a GC-friendly cache</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2bf3ae9">
<p>
Say, your software creates something that is expensive and we would like
to improve the overall performance by caching instances of it once
they are created. We might want to go about building a cache that allows
us to do something like this.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Insert items into cache without worrying about the number of entries
in it.</li>
<li>When the program runs short of memory, discard some or all cached entries.</li>
<li>When a cache lookup finds a discarded entry, treat it the same as item not in cache.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trick to accomplishing all this without a lot of house keeping is
to wrap the cached values in instances of
<b>java.lang.Ref.SoftReference</b>. The garbage collector has a notion of
variable strength references. A normal reference to an object, also
called strong reference, is one where the object is reachable from the
roots of the program through a list of normal references. Instances
which have strong references to them are not eligible for garbage
collection. An object with a <b>SoftReference</b> doesn't have any strong
references to it and the garbage collector is free to reclaim it at
its discretion.
</p>

<p>
The following gist illustrates how the garbage collector treats soft
references to objects. Notice that a garbage collection cycle which
reclaims enough memory will leave the soft references unclaimed. When
memory is scarce, however, soft references will be reclaimed by
garbage collection.
</p>

<p>
&lt;script src="<a href="https://gist.github.com/MonadicT/8655216.js">https://gist.github.com/MonadicT/8655216.js</a>"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</p>

<p>
Here is the output produced by this code. You can see that soft
references get cleared when memory is scarce.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre><code class="src src-bash">$ java SoftReferenceTest
Populating cache with 1000 objects
Count of objects in cache after population: 1000
Count of objects in cache after System.gc: 1000
Triggering OutOfMemoryError
Count of objects in cache after OOME: 10
$
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
What would happen if we used <b>java.lang.ref.WeakReference</b> instead of
<b>SoftReference</b>? The difference between soft and weak references is in
how aggressively garbage collector reclaims them. JDK documentation
for <b>WeakReference</b> states that when garbage collector determines an
object to be only weakly reachable, it will clear all weak references
to that object. In contrast, when garbage collector determines an
object to be softly reachable, it <b>may</b> clear soft references to
it.
</p>

<p>
Here is another gist illustrating the difference between
<b>SoftReference</b> and <b>WeakReference</b>. This gist replaces all
occurrences of <b>SoftReference</b> with <b>WeakReference</b>. From the run
output, you can see that the weak references to objects don't seem to
survive the process of building the hash map and System.gc() call
clears them immediately.
</p>

<p>
&lt;script src="<a href="https://gist.github.com/MonadicT/8655216.js">https://gist.github.com/MonadicT/8655216.js</a>"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</p>

<p>
Output from running the above gist.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre><code class="src src-bash">$ java WeakReferenceTest
Populating cache with 1000 objects
Count of objects in cache after population: 278
Count of objects in cache after System.gc: 10
Triggering OutOfMemoryError
Count of objects in cache after OOME: 10
$
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
While <b>SoftReference</b> looks great for building caches which
automatically get smaller when memory becomes scarce, what are
<b>WeakReferences</b> good for? That is the subject of next section.

<h3 id="orgb92ee86">Weak Hash Map</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb92ee86">
<p>
The JDK documentation for <b>WeakReference</b> says, weak references are
used to build canonicalized mappings. A canonicalized mapping to an
object always resolves to the same object. Consider the use case
described at the beginning where we would like to associate additional
information with an instance of a final class. Obviously, we should be
able to retrieve the same information that we associated with the
object at all times. While we could use a hash map with the object as
key, all the housekeeping will have to be done by the developer.
</p>

<p>
This where a <b>WeakReference</b> proves handy. Instead of storing the key
of the object directly, the key is wrapped in <b>WeakReference</b>. Say we
have an object instance and with it we associate some information. We
can query the weak hash map with the object as the key. If the object
instance gets reclaimed, the only reference to it would be its use as
a key in the weak hash map. As we saw earlier, garbage collector
reclaims weak references right away and the key is put on a
queue. When any operations are invoked on the weak hash map, all weak
references waiting in the queue are removed from the map.
</p>

<p>
Note that keys used in <b>WeakHashMap</b> should not have any embedded strong
references to them in the code and nor in the additional information
we associated with it as the value. If the key is an interned string,
the key will never become weakly referenced.
</p>

<h3 id="org8889c42">Phantom Reference</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8889c42">
<p>
Now we come to the last scenario discussed in the beginning. Java
objects can have a <b>finalize</b> method in which you can perform cleanup
actions. Java doesn't specify how soon the <b>finalize</b> method will be
invoked and which thread will execute the method. Joshua Bloch, author
of <b>Effective Java</b>, also points out the performance penalty of
defining <b>finalize</b> and strongly recommends avoiding it. <b>finalize</b>
seems to be one of the features of Java better left untouched.
Thankfully, <b>PhantomReference</b> is designed to address the problem of
executing cleanup actions in a safe manner.
</p>

<p>
Using <b>PhantomReference</b> requires a little more effort than other
reference types. For starters, phantom references don't return their
referent ever. That prevents you from creating strong references to an
object that has been finalized. It also requires you to subclass
<b>PhantomReference</b> and maintain data needed to cleanup the referent
when it is reclaimed. Phantom references must also be associated with
a reference queue and a background thread is required to monitor the
queue for references enqueued by garbage collector and do the cleanup
actions as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Here is a gist which shows how phantom references should be
used. Real code should probably be structured so that each object
needing cleanup action should return an instance of <b>PhantomReference</b>
subclass encapsulating the cleanup data.
