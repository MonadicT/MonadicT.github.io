* Theory
- C_i -- input coupling capacitor. Isolates grid circuit from dc
  voltage. Controls the frequency response of stage.
- R_g -- grid resistor. Provides a reference voltage
  (ground). Usuually a high value (1MOhm). Controls the frequency
  response of stage.
- R_k -- cathode resistor which develops cathode bias
  voltage. Controls the headroom and linearity of the stage. If this
  resistor is unbypassed, also controls the gain.
- C_k -- cathode bypass capacitor which bypasses the cathode resistor
  to ground for AC signals. Without this, there is will be negative
  feedback. C_k must be large enough compared to R_k to avoid
  affecting the frequency response (gain is boosted at higher
  frequencies than lower frequencies).
- R_p -- plate load resistor. Output voltage is developed by the plate
  current flowing through it. This resistor controls the gain and
  the output impedance of the stage.
- C_o -- output coupling capacitor. Isolates DC plate DC voltage from
  the next output stage. Controls the frequency of the stage along
  with input resistance of the the next stage.
- R_l -- load resistor (also the grid resistor of the next
  stage). Controls the midband gain of the stage. If it is made 10X
  larger than R_p, it can be ignored in calculations.

Biasing:
- Choose R_p to be 2X internal plate resistance.
- Draw a load line representing plate resistor.
- Find bias point, the intersection of the grid bias voltage curve and
  the plate current axis at the plate voltage point that gives
  the desired range of plate voltage swing as the grid voltage varies
  from cutoff to saturation.
- V_g = grid bias voltage at the bias point
- I_p  = plate current at the bias point
- Cathode resistor value: Rk = V_g/I_p

Gain:
- Total resistance, R_a = R_p || R_l
- A_V = (\mu * R_a)/(R_a + ra)

Voltage gain in dBv:
- dB = 20 * log(V1/V2)

Input impedance:
- For low frequencies, approximately equal to R_g. At higher
  frequencies, impedance drops due to Miller's capacitance.

Frequency response:
- Low frequency response controlled by C_i and R_g (high-pass band
  filter). lower -3dB frequency, f = 1/(2*pi*R_g*C_i).
- High frequency response controlled by input capacitance of the stage
  and output resistance of the stage driving this.

Output impedance:
- R = ra || R_p

- Cathode bias resistor must be bypassed to get maximum gain and
  minimum noise
- Absolute maximum input level is determined by voltage across the
  cathode resistor
- If cathode resutor voltage is +1V, grid input voltage must never
  exceed +1V at positive peaks. If it does, grid will become positive
  and draw current, resulting in distortion,
- For high input levels, the signal must be attenuated before it
  reaches the grid,
- Valve's maximum cathode current must not be exceeded
- Maximum plate dissipation must not be exceeded

Basic parameters of 12AX7
| V_a (V) | I_a (mA) | V_g(V) |  g_m | \mu | r_P (k) |
|     250 |      1.2 |     -2 | 1600 | 100 |    62.5 |
|     100 |      0.5 |     -1 | 1250 | 100 |      80 |

- First step in valve amp design, determine the operational characteristics
- Pick plate current (say, 0.5mA)
- From plate current, determine grid voltage, (-1V)
- Calculate plate load resistor value (for B+ of 150V, need 50V drop at 0.5mA. R = 50/0.5 = 100k)
- Plate resistor is in parallel with r_p and R_g of next stage, the total resistance is 42.5k (how?)
- At 100V, mutual conductance is 1.25mA/V. If input is varied by
  100mV, valve current will vary by $1.25*0.1=0.125mA$. This current
  across 42.5k total load resistance develops 5.3V which results in a gain of 53.
- The gain can be reduced by increasing the grid resistor of the next
  stage or adding a bias resistor to the cathode circuit (why do we need to reduce the gain?)

-  R_s - Small resistance in series with control grid - stopper -
  prevents the valve from detecting AM radio signals. It acts to
  prevent high-frequency parasitic oscillations in the tube. Limits
  grid current when tube is driven into positive grid region.

  This resistor must be directly soldered to the pin with a very short
  lead and should be placed after the grid-to-ground resistor (1M)

  Grid resistor values are usually between 0-68K. Higher values drop the
  frequency response.

- Grid to ground resistor (R_G) - 1M
- Cathode resistor (R_k) - 2k
- R_P - 100k
- R_L 1M
- C_k - cathode bypass
- C_c - coupling capacitor

Gain calculation in cathode resistance bypassed

$R_{source} = r_P + ( \mu * R_K )$

R_{tot} = R_P || R_{load}

* Glossary
Class A amplifier: grid bias and applied grid voltage are such that
plate current flows at all times.

Plate curves: plate current as a function of plate voltage and grid
voltage.

Anode resistance, r_a: ratio of change in anode voltage to change of
anode current. (r_a=\Delta{}V_a/\Delta{}I_a)

Amplification factor, \mu: ratio of anode voltage to grid voltage for a fixed anode
current (\mu=\Delta{}V_a/\Delta{}V_g)

Transconductance, g_m: g_m=\Delta{}I_a/\Delta{}V_g

Loadline:

Input coupling capacitor: Isolates the grid circuit from DC voltage
from the previous stage. This capacitor along with the grid resistor
determines the frequency response of the stage.

Grid resistor: provides a reference voltage
for the grid circuit. Usually a high value (1M). This determines the
input impedance for the stage.

Cathode resistor, R_k: provides cathode bias voltage. Cathode current
through this resistor develops a positive voltage at the cathode of
tube. This positive voltage results in a negative grid voltage. This
resistor controls the headroom, linearity of the stage. When
unbypassed, it also controls the gain.

Cathode bypass capacitor, C_k: bypasses AC signals to ground.

Plate load resistor, R_p: develops output signal voltage when plate
current flows through it. The value of the plate resistance controls
the gain.  It also controls the output impedance of the stage.
