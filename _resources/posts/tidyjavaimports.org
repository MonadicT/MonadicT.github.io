* Tidying Java Imports
I try to avoid programming in Java but there are those pesky times
when Java is the right tool. I have no desire to install the 800-pound
gorilla of IDEs, I can't quite use the =eclim= package (an Eclipse
plugin which exposes Eclipse features through a server interface). I
don't find the IntelliSense all that useful. However, I do want to be
able to organize my =import= statements and remove unused classes to
keep the clutter to a minimum. The following is a quick hack in elisp
to accomplish the removal of unused Java classes.

Note, this works well when you import each class by name. Wildcard
im-ports are not handled with this.

  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((start (point-min))
          (end (point-max))
          imports
          unused
          last-import-line)
      (beginning-of-buffer)
      (while (< (point) end)
        (let ((ln (buffer-substring-no-properties (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))
          (if (string-match "import[\t ]*.*\\.\\([A-Za-z0-9]+\\)" ln)
              (progn
                (setq last-import-line (count-lines 1 (point)))
                (add-to-list
                 'imports
